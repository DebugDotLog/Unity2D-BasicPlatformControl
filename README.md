# Unity2D-BasicPlatformControl
This project contains my solution for /r/Unity2D Weekly Challenge #2 - Basic Platform Control:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity2D/comments/35blmu/weekly_challenge_2_basic_platformer_control/

It uses two C# scripts to accomplish this:

/Assets/Scripts/BallMover.cs - This script controls the horizontal movement of the player.
/Assets/Scripts/BallVerticalState.cs - This script uses a rudimentary state machine to control the vertical state of the player.

The scripts aren't seperated for any particular reason. They're bastardized snippets of the movement script I'm currently writing for my first game.
