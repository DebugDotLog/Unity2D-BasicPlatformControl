# Unity2D-BasicPlatformControl
This project contains my solution for /r/Unity2D Weekly Challenge #2 - Basic Platform Control

It uses two C# scripts to accomplish this:

/Assets/Scripts/BallMover.cs - This script controls the horizontal movement of the player.
/Assets/Scripts/BallVerticalState.cs - This script uses a rudimentary state machine to control the vertical state of the player.

The scripts aren't seperated for any particular reason. They're bastardized snippits of the movement script I'm currently writing for my first game.
